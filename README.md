# Ground-Truth or DAER
This is the repository for the paper titled [Ground-Truth or DAER: Selective Re-query of Secondary Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07414). The work is divided into two individual tasks, [hierarchical scene classification](https://github.com/lemmersj/ground-truth-or-daer/tree/main/hsc) and [keypoint-conditioned viewpoint estimation](https://github.com/lemmersj/ground-truth-or-daer/tree/main/kcve), stored in their respective folders in the repositories.

The hierarchical scene classification code is based on the repository for the WACV paper "Plugin Networks for Inference under Partial Evidence ([paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/papers/Koperski_Plugin_Networks_for_Inference_under_Partial_Evidence_WACV_2020_paper.pdf), [code](https://github.com/tooploox/plugin-networks))."

The keypoint-conditioned viewpoint estimation code is based on a pytorch adaptation of the ICCV paper "Click Here: Human-Localized Keypoints as Guidance for Viewpoint Estimation ([paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Szeto_Click_Here_Human-Localized_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf), [original repository](https://github.com/rszeto/click-here-cnn), [PyTorch adaptation](https://github.com/mbanani/pytorch-clickhere-cnn))
